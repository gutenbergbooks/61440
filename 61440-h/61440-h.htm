<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ig"><span class="letra">J</span>EW-BAITING still! Two thousand years are run<br /></span>
<span class="ih">And still, it seems, good Master Chesterton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing’s abated of the old offence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changing its shape, it never changes tense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other things were, this only was and is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whether Judas murder with a kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Shylock catch a Christian with a gin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All all’s the same&mdash;the first enormous sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traps Judas in the moneylender’s mesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cuts from Jesus’ side the pound of flesh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is this all the punishment. For still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through centuries to suffer were no ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we in human axes and the rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discerned the high pro-consulate of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chastening his people. But we are not chastened.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Age after age upon our hearts is fastened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same cold malice, and for all they bleed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They burn for ever with unchanging greed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grosser with suffering we grow, and one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls to another “If in Babylon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are gold and silver, be content with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better found gold than lost Jerusalem.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They forget Zion; in the market place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuild the Temple for the Jewish race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus from age to age do Jews like me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have their revenge on Christianity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thus from age to age Christians like you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchristian grow in hounding down the Jew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus from age to age His will is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Shylock’s sins produce a Chesterton.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But since we both must suffer and both are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound in the orb of one outrageous star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hater and hated, for a little while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us together watch how mile on mile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavenly moon, all milky white, regains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her gentle empery, and smooths the stains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of red our star left in her heaven, thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing a respite even unto us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the red star strikes again. The riot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the heart for a moment sinks, and in the quiet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a cool bandage on the forehead be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content a second with tranquillity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from your lips the secular taunt of dog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banish, to hear what in the synagogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard once at Barmitzvah (as we call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The confirmation, when the praying shawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is for the first time worn, and the boy waits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For law and manhood at the altar gates).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether ’tis true or no, it shall be true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">just long enough to build a bridge to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hangs a shining second till your laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reminds me of my ducats and my daughter.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It happened thus. When the last “adonoi”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had faltered into silence of some boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose voice was all a silver miracle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of water, a voice echoed “Israel,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweeter voice than even his, but broken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a sorrowful thrill, as though the heart had spoken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of countless generations doomed to pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none to ease them found. It cried again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so we thought who listened, “Ye do well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let the children come, O Israel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even these are lost and unforgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since not of these His kingdom and His heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who at their fathers’ fathers’ hands was sold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Calvary; and not their voice, though gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor innocent eyes, nor ways that children have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of magic in their reaching hands, can save.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though ye offer these as sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nation’s childhood is too small a price<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay the interest upon the debt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all your sorrows cannot liquidate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O what a usury our God has made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On thirty pieces that the high priest paid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Profit was none, but from the first the loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grew of the fourth ghost upon the Cross.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two on the Cross were seen at Jesus’ side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth, the fourth unseen and crucified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With piercéd hands and feet, and heart as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghost betrayed of traitor Israel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yourselves ye bought and sold, yourselves decreed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the end of the world your doom. For who will heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prayer or utter mercy on a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However sweet he call? The heart is wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your own ghost, and not the softest lamb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God escapes his sentence. For I am<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wraith of all your children from the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ere their birth inexorably cursed.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None saw the ghost. Some said it was the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spoke. Yet someone answered “adonoi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy will be done” and it was finished. All<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closer about their foreheads drew the shawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing to see, and as the darkness grows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeper save where above the altar glows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One lamp, in hearts that Pharoah would unharden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pity rises not a cry for pardon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the Mills of God a bitter call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Grind quickly, since ye grind exceeding small!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That is the tale. But mark, the moon in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hid with clouds. This little time was given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To peace and to remembering one another<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who might have been (God knows) brother with brother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since ’tis over and the peace is done<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Travelling, where beauty ends, what beauty is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world and the light no longer his.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while they brought it, women, as they use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang in the house the litany of Zeus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the god of gods, yet could not save<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Must droop upon the ground and perish there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even her hair (the women sung), alas<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lost for a god and found, when he, with mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About him of its glory twist on twist,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&mdash;Even that hair, for all a high god’s art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since is dust, and dust that was her heart.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This song of ending in the darkness came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pheidias in the courtyard, where the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of torches threw a final light and shewed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two pillars of the house, a turn of road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That led (he thought) beyond all sight, and he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must walk it with a quiet company<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;The cold imagined gods, no prayer might cozen<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In marble out of his heart where they were waiting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life, had carved, and given them instead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life the eternal gesture of the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He with those gods must walk, since he had grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into their silence, and had made his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their longings thus imprisoned, and their heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one beat fixed for ever. He must start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow, but before his striving spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steps out upon the road or falters near it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One god, that guards the passage, waiting stands&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His latest marble, made like those, with hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fashioned, like those, of a man’s dreams, but overstepping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His maker’s mind, and into a glory sweeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man might share. For the great forehead lifted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the shade of life, and light had shifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her quality, whose radiant indecision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found, though the eyes were closed, consummate vision.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the god that dying Pheidias<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had beaten out of marble. This he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would not share with other gods their death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In beauty, but was living with the breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his creator, who with death at strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid down his own to give his creature life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This god they brought to Pheidias, for whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole great world had been a little room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he had used, as others use, but he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked through the window on eternity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeing his god, upon his mind the cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faded an instant, and he cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though all Hellas heard him, “O be proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty, Hellas, nor be curious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what the secret is that haunted us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your poets, who had strained to it, and after<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay down to sleep, sealing their lips with laughter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For laughter is the judgment of the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who measure equally with level eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the world is, what gods, and what are men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twixt too great a joy, too sharp a pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strikes on a balance, so that tears are shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With laughter, laughter with tears, and these are not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves, but greater than themselves, and each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From other learns and doth to other teach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are content with beauty thus, who find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when all’s done&mdash;sculpture or song&mdash;behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What we have carved or sung, a greater thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startles the heart with movement of a wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We neither see nor dare see. For our thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is larger than we know, and what we sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passes and has forgotten; what we do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth we did not guess at pierces through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If what was done was well done. This last bust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mine not as I willed but as I must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I carved, and now, at the end of all, I can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See that the dream he does not dream is man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earlier gods I carved and knew, they wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My coming as their master at the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death, for what I knew is mine to have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live with my life, and wither in my grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus beauty known is fading, known love fades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the truth we know a shadow in the shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only that which lies beyond our hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty, no earth-bound spirit understands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But guesses at and faints for in desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love, that does not burn, because the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is lit beyond the world, and truth that dies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond our thoughts in unimagined lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That are the truth beyond truth, only these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are lasting and outwit our memories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the familiar gods that I have made&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those I will not walk. O be afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty attainable and love attained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And limited immortality. Unchained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest soul must walk and walk alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what it has not seen and has not known!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Pheidias spoke and presently the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of torches died, his god that had no name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;His latest statue&mdash;watched his spirit pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dawn came that knew not Pheidias.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of Venus, also an Evangelist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“So little is the conquest of the flesh,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of stars, and the moon upon her silent spindle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did all the velvet warp to silver kindle.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As almost to persuade us that they are,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of patterns laid-up in heaven. Socrates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A citizen of Athens, was betrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death for teaching this, and smiling laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cup of hemlock down, because his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already of eternity was part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death for such is freedom. Yet for this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did surrender the Acropolis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had all Hellas for a coronet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her forehead radiantly set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Island on island, and for this forsook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friendship of his friends, his dreams, the look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hesitating spring that dare not stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet will not leave the hills of Attica.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this all gifts, all memories, he gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freely believing that the narrow grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the end of all. Thus he passed out alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content to face the gods no man had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they beggar knowledge, and persuaded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was enough, that, when for him had faded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light, for us his death a light had lit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would shew a path and we might walk by it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘This is the spirit of man; in vain it reaches<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At the empty mouth of the grave, because my king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has made the grave a refuge and protection<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the pain of living by His resurrection.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Socrates sleeps; the god he did not know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeps with him, and long since the grasses grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above their resting place, but flowers reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain their roots to find Him whom I preach.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is not there, but though we darkly see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a glass, his immortality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits for us all, and beckons in the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where we who find Him see Him face to face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Socrates, to death a prisoner, did well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But death was all; Christ by the miracle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the open grave, his deity forsaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the world has death a prisoner taken.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Socrates in vain all sacrificed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If here his fruitless death has pled for Christ.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dionysius the Areopagite<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Faded upon the sculptured face. The night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloaked it, and, though Paul pressed, the threatened blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung in the air and fell not. For a low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange glory changed upon the face, and seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A face that Paul had seen before or dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see when near Damascus, and instead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pheidias’ god unknown another Head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrowful-sweet on Paul astonished shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ere his threatening hand could fall, was gone.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The plan by which individual Viennese are allowed to obtain their
own wood supplies has already been described by more than one
observer. It will, however, in time to come appear so incredible,
and it so completely sums up the misery of the people and the
breakdown of civilization and administration, that no excuse is
needed for placing it once more formally and definitely on record.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of Vienna lies a forest known as the
Wienerwald, the nearest point being on hills to the north, two or
three miles from the centre of the city.</p>

<p>The two chief centres of wood collection are the suburbs of
Hütteldorf and Dorhbach.</p>

<p>The prevalence of women and children among the collectors is the
most painful feature of the proceedings.”</p>
